A tech blog website

## Description

The goal for this asignment was to plan, design and build a blog website for a fictional client. I made one for a tech company. It allows visitors to explore blog posts, read blog posts, and share them. And it allows the owner to make an account to manage the posts by creating, editing or deleting them. I had focus on responsiveness and user experience.

- Home page with a carousel showing the 3 latest posts, and a grid showing 12 latest posts
- Functionality to create a user and log in
- Logged in users can create, edit and update posts
- Shareable URL for each blog post

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

2. Open the project in your browser

## Improvements

To improve this project, I would add pagination, and search and sorting functionality.
